# Project_Par_3

# What makes the best golfers in the World better than the rest?
The goal of our project is figure out what separates the top ten golfers from the rest of the rankings according to https://www.cbssports.com/golf/rankings/ with data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddho22/pga-tour-statistics?select=data.csv.

We chose after looking over the raw data to use 10 different factors we believed would show what makes the top ten better than everyone else. The factors we chose were Driving Distance, Driving Accuracy Percentage, Greens in Regulation Percentage, Putts Per Round, Rough Tendency, Scrambling, Proximity to Hole, Approaches from inside 100 yards, Approaches from > 100 yards, and Sand Save Percentage.

# Results

Driving Distance- was a big Factor with the top 10 players hitting the ball on average 7 yards longer than the next group 11-25 with the gap only growing the further down the rankings you go.
Driving Accuracy Percentage- was a non-factor in determining what made the best players better than the rest with all ranking ranges being some where between 58-62% with the top ten being at 59%.
 Greens in Regulation Percentage- was lead by the top ten at nearly 70% but was basically no different then the rest of the field.
Putts Per Round- was an interesting as both the 11-25 and 51-100 had on average almost one less putt per round.
Scrambling- At 70% the top ten golfers where 2-3% points better than the field at making par or better.
Proximity to Hole- All groups where on average 37-39 ft from the hole basically no difference between the rankings groupings.
Approaches from inside 100 yards- the top ten had the least number of approaches at 16 with the other groups being a 17 and above.
Approaches from > 100 yards- with all the groups being equal around 34 approaches
Sand Save Percentage- at nearly 55% the top ten was 2-5% better than the rest of the field.

# Conclusion

The Golfer that hits the ball the farthest, has a good scrambing percentage and has a good percentage in the sand  is more likely to be the difference between being in the top ten and not.

# How the work was distributed

# Cameron Pulling 
•	Created Golf Data Cleaned.ipynb where the data was cleaned and merged with the World Gold Ranking from CBS. 

•	The data was then broken down into the ranking ranges 1-10, 11-25, 26-50, 51-100, and 100+ to better find trends among the groups of gilfers.

•	Created the Driving Distance Bar Chart

•	Created the Power Point Presentation

# Trevor Moore 
•	Set up the GitHub repository 

•	Updated the ReadMe 

•	Convert that data to a json file

# Vincent Elequin 
•	using (insert file/files name and path to it here) created a drop-down menu to select the golfer of your choice with an interactive bar graph displaying all the golfers values except Driving Distance.

•	Created the layout for the HTML file.

# Nick Leisenring 
•	Created GolfChart pngs and the GolfChart.ipynb by using rankings ranges to create line graphs. We are able to compare groupings of the world golf rankings and determine which factors separate the best in the world.
